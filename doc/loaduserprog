Executing and Loading User Programs
  Linux maintains a table of functions for loading
   programs; it gives each function the opportunity to try
   loading the given file when an exec system call is made.
   
  The registration of multiple loader routines allows Linux
   to support both the ELF and a.out binary formats.
   
  Initially, binary-file pages are mapped into virtual
   memory; only when a program tries to access a given
   page will a page fault result in that page being loaded
   into physical memory.
   
  An ELF-format binary file consists of a header followed
   by several page-aligned sections; the ELF loader works
   by reading the header and mapping the sections of the
   file into separate regions of virtual memory.
